# Week 1 - Hello World

**Author:** Robert Jordan

## Code Walkthrough

This is a pretty simple project, but a little extra for a Hello World project. I added multiple lines and spiced up the display by butting the text in a fancy box. I also put a joke above to go with Hello World and added a `press any key to continue` portion to the end to help go with the upcoming week 3 project of displaying other java projects. If these projects instantly end, then these projects won't have the time to display to the user before reverting input back to the week 3 program.

## What have I learned this week

I first learned that NetBeans doesn't like to make it quick and easy to change the `main` class file in a single project. It took me awhile to find the ability to run a different `main` class and even longer to find how to change it permanently. I may try to switch to individual projects per assignment but that might start to make the nested folders worse and worse.

I'm also definitely not a fan of how slow the output and input are in the NetBeans debug terminal. Half a second per line is incredibly slow and completely unacceptable. I'll need to look in hooking the IDE up to a regular Windows command prompt console.

I am slowly familiarizing myself with the buttons, but not all of them seem to have good placement when it comes to guessing what they do. I also wish NetBeans wouldn't keep opening up new output windows *every* single time I change something. Every 5 minutes or so I have to go and clean them all up.

I also had a challenge trying to make the Hello World assignment at least *a little* unique. Hello World gets boring after awhile so I wanted to spice it up a bit. It's not much of an improvement, but it looks nice and has a joke in it so it's good enough for me.

## Are you thinking the same thing, gaining insights

Still thinking pretty much the same thing as walking in, although I've realized that I do prefer Eclipse over NetBeans, there are just too many things I find issue in with it.
